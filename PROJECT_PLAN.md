# OwlTask Software Requirements Document

## Project Description

### What's the Problem?

In today's collaborative work environment, teams struggle with fragmented task management that leads to missed deadlines, unclear responsibilities, and poor coordination. Current solutions either lack real-time collaboration features or are overly complex for small to medium teams. The fundamental problem is that team members lose visibility into project progress and struggle to understand how their individual contributions fit into the larger picture.

**Target Audience**: Small to medium-sized teams (5-20 members) including:
- Project managers who need oversight of team progress
- Team members who need clarity on their responsibilities and deadlines
- Cross-functional teams requiring real-time coordination

**Why This Matters**: Poor task coordination leads to project delays, duplicated effort, and team frustration. A streamlined, real-time task management system can significantly improve team productivity and project success rates.

### How Will OwlTask Address the Problem?

OwlTask provides a unified platform for real-time task coordination with intelligent status summaries. Unlike traditional task managers that simply list tasks, OwlTask focuses on **contextual awareness** - helping teams understand not just what needs to be done, but how everything connects and progresses together.

**Unique Approach**: Integration of AI-powered status summaries that provide natural language insights into project progress, making it easy for team members to quickly understand "where we are" without diving into detailed task lists.

**Key Advantages**:
- Real-time synchronization eliminates information lag
- Natural language status queries reduce cognitive load
- Lightweight design ensures quick adoption
- Extensible architecture supports future growth

**Potential Disadvantages**:
- Requires consistent internet connectivity for real-time features
- AI summaries depend on external API availability

**UC5: Deadline Management**
- **Actor**: All Users
- **Goal**: Stay aware of approaching deadlines
- **Scenario**: System proactively notifies users of upcoming deadlines and overdue tasks
