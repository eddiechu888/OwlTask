# OwlTask Software Requirements Document

## Project Description

### What's the Problem?

In today's collaborative work environment, teams struggle with fragmented task management that leads to missed deadlines, unclear responsibilities, and poor coordination. Current solutions either lack real-time collaboration features or are overly complex for small to medium teams. The fundamental problem is that team members lose visibility into project progress and struggle to understand how their individual contributions fit into the larger picture.

**Target Audience**: Small to medium-sized teams (5-20 members) including:
- Project managers who need oversight of team progress
- Team members who need clarity on their responsibilities and deadlines
- Cross-functional teams requiring real-time coordination

**Why This Matters**: Poor task coordination leads to project delays, duplicated effort, and team frustration. A streamlined, real-time task management system can significantly improve team productivity and project success rates.

### How Will OwlTask Address the Problem?

OwlTask provides a unified platform for real-time task coordination with intelligent status summaries. Unlike traditional task managers that simply list tasks, OwlTask focuses on **contextual awareness** - helping teams understand not just what needs to be done, but how everything connects and progresses together.

**Unique Approach**: Integration of AI-powered status summaries that provide natural language insights into project progress, making it easy for team members to quickly understand "where we are" without diving into detailed task lists.

**Key Advantages**:
- Real-time synchronization eliminates information lag
- Natural language status queries reduce cognitive load
- Lightweight design ensures quick adoption
- Extensible architecture supports future growth

**Potential Disadvantages**:
- Requires consistent internet connectivity for real-time features
- AI summaries depend on external API availability

## Use Case Descriptions

### Primary Use Cases

- **Actor**: Project Manager/Team Lead
- **Goal**: Create and assign tasks to team members
- **Scenario**: Manager creates a task with description, priority, due date, and assigns to specific team member or group
- **Success Criteria**: Task is created, assigned user receives notification, task appears in relevant views

**UC2: Real-time Status Updates**
- **Actor**: Team Member
- **Goal**: Update task progress and see current team status
- **Scenario**: User updates their task status, system broadcasts changes to all connected team members
- **Success Criteria**: All team members see updated status immediately, no data conflicts

**UC3: Intelligent Progress Inquiry**
- **Actor**: Project Manager/Team Member
- **Goal**: Get contextual summary of project progress
- **Scenario**: User asks "How's progress since Monday?" and receives AI-generated summary of completed tasks, upcoming deadlines, and current blockers
- **Success Criteria**: User receives relevant, accurate summary within 5 seconds

**UC4: Group Coordination**
- **Actor**: Team Member
- **Goal**: Coordinate work within assigned groups
- **Scenario**: User views group tasks, sees what teammates are working on, identifies dependencies

### Strategic Omissions Rationale

**Focus on Core Mission**: OwlTask's fundamental goal is real-time task coordination with intelligent status insights. Every omitted feature, while potentially valuable, doesn't directly contribute to this core mission within our 5-week constraint.

**80/20 Rule Applied**: The included features address 80% of small team coordination needs with 20% of the possible implementation effort. Complex permission systems, hierarchical tasks, and advanced communication features serve edge cases that don't justify their development cost.

**Extensibility Preserved**: The modular MVVM architecture with clear separation of concerns makes it straightforward to add omitted features in future releases:
- Observer pattern ready for complex notification systems
- Strategy pattern enables pluggable authorization schemes
- Composite pattern prepared for hierarchical task structures
- Repository pattern supports advanced filtering and search

### Implementation Effort Estimates

**Total Omitted Effort**: ~35-50 weeks of development
**Core Implementation**: ~4-5 weeks
**Effort Ratio**: We're implementing roughly 10% of possible features to deliver 80% of core value

This focused approach ensures we can deliver a polished, working application that solves the fundamental coordination problem rather than a feature-rich but incomplete system.
