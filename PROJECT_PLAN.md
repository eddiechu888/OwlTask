# OwlTask Requirements Document

## 1. Project Description

### Problem Statement
Modern task management and coordination across individuals and groups suffers from several critical limitations:
- **Lack of Real-time Synchronization**: Most existing tools require manual refreshing to see updates, leading to outdated information and coordination failures
- **Poor Group Coordination**: Current solutions focus primarily on individual task management, with limited support for group dynamics, role-based permissions, and collaborative workflows
- **Information Overload**: Users struggle to get quick, contextual summaries of project status without manually reviewing multiple tasks and updates
- **Fragmented Communication**: Task updates, notifications, and status reports are often scattered across different platforms, reducing efficiency

### Importance of the Problem
Effective task coordination is fundamental to productivity in academic, professional, and personal contexts. Poor coordination leads to:
- Missed deadlines and duplicated work
- Reduced team productivity and morale
- Lack of accountability and transparency
- Difficulty in tracking progress and identifying bottlenecks

### Proposed Solution
OwlTask addresses these problems by providing a web-based task management platform that emphasizes:
- **Real-time Coordination**: WebSocket-based synchronization ensures all users see updates immediately
- **Group-Centric Design**: Built-in support for groups, roles, and collaborative task management
- **Intelligent Status Summaries**: GPT-4o integration provides natural language summaries of project status and progress
- **Unified Interface**: Single platform for task creation, assignment, tracking, and communication

## 2. Use Case Descriptions

### Persona 1: Project Manager (Sarah)
**Background**: Graduate student leading a research team of 5 members working on a semester-long project with multiple deliverables.

**Use Case 1.1: Project Setup and Team Coordination**
- Sarah creates a new group called "Research Team Alpha"
- She invites team members and assigns roles (Lead Researcher, Data Analyst, Writer, etc.)
- She creates high-level tasks for major deliverables (Literature Review, Data Collection, Analysis, Final Report)
- She assigns tasks to specific team members based on their roles and expertise

**Use Case 1.2: Progress Monitoring and Status Updates**
- Sarah queries the system: "How's our progress since last week?"
- The system uses GPT-4o to analyze recent task completions, upcoming deadlines, and current assignments
- She receives a natural language summary: "The team completed 3 of 5 literature review tasks. Data collection is 60% complete with 2 days remaining. John needs support on statistical analysis as his task is overdue by 1 day."
- She can quickly identify bottlenecks and reassign resources as needed

### Persona 2: Team Member (Alex)
**Background**: Undergraduate student participating in multiple group projects while managing individual coursework.

**Use Case 2.1: Task Management Across Multiple Groups**
- Alex belongs to 3 different project groups with varying deadlines
- He views his personalized dashboard showing all assigned tasks sorted by priority and due date
- He receives real-time notifications when new tasks are assigned or deadlines change
- He updates task status from "In Progress" to "Completed" and adds completion notes

**Use Case 2.2: Collaborative Task Execution**
- Alex is assigned a task that depends on another team member's completion
- He receives automatic notifications when prerequisite tasks are completed
- He collaborates on shared tasks by adding comments and status updates
- Other team members see his progress in real-time without manual reporting

### Persona 3: Course Instructor (Dr. Martinez)
**Background**: Professor managing multiple course sections with group projects requiring oversight and evaluation.

**Use Case 3.1: Multi-Group Oversight**
- Dr. Martinez has administrator access to all student project groups in her course
